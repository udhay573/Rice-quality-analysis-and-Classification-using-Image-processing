# Rice-quality-analysis-and-Classification-using-Image-processing
We classify the taken rice grain sample into different categories and also analyze its quality based on the aspect ratio, so comparison with other works is not possible. Existing work only detects the rice grains or calculates the number of rice grains in the given sample, but our work helps analyze the quality of the rice sample and place it into a specific category. The quality of the grains in the samples is nearly 100% accurate and capable of efficiently classifying high-value grains, which is otherwise very time-consuming in manual analysis. This function can save a lot of time and manpower.
